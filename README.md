## Description
This application is an interactive map of NYC attractions and its subway lines, based on the transit data provided by the MTA. The map also displays the date along with up-to-date weather information for New York City with the help of Yahoo Weather API. 
For this project, I used Javascript, jQuery, Knockout, Ajax, Google Maps API, Foursquare API and the Yahoo Weather API to create an accesible map of popular attractions within a specific radius from Manhattan.
